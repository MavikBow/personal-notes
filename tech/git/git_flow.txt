Branches:
-	Feature branches: for features
-	Develop branch: unstable, combining features
-	Release branches: stabilizing develop, bug fixing, documentation
-	Main branch: production
-	Hotfix branch: fixes production swiftly (and other branches?)

Pros:
Good for large projects with a lot of people. 
Better product stability.
Ease of programming numerous new features simultaneously.

Cons:
Merges galore.
Delayed feature implementation.
Hard to maintain.

Flow:
      o---o---o            feature 1
     /         \
o---o---o---o---o---o---o  develop 
     \             /
      o---o---o---o        feature 2


o---o----o'----o'---o---o  develop 
     \             /
      o---o---o---o        release
                   \
--------------------o      main

Developers create a new feature branch off the develop branch. 
Once a feature is complete, it merges back into develop.
When ready for a release, a release branch is created off develop.
After final touches, it merges into main (and back into develop), 
leading to a new release version.
