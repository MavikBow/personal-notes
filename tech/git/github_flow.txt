Flow:
      o---o                feature 1
     /     \
o---o---o---o---o---o---o  main
     \         /    ^
      o---o---o     |      feature 2
                   tag?

========================

Branches:
-	Main branch: prod
-	Feature/Hotfix branches: branch out of and into the main branch

Pros:
Swift changes.
Rapid development.
Ease of maintenance.
Less merges.

Cons:
Needs more rigorous testing.
	(automated testing paramount)
Harder to work on parallel features.
May be less stable

Though in my experience, github flow projects use tags
to mark stable points in the main branch.

========================

CI/CD:
All feature branches undergo automated testing.
Small incremental changes are expected.
Very fast to deploy. Easier to auto test.
