git-rebase(1):

  Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":

                A---B---C topic
               /
          D---E---F---G master

  From this point, the result of either of the following commands:

      git rebase master
      git rebase master topic

  would be:

                        A'--B'--C' topic
                       /
          D---E---F---G master

  NOTE: The latter form is just a short-hand of git checkout topic followed by git rebase master. When rebase exits topic will remain the checked-out branch.

the full command sequence would be:

```bash
git rebase master topic
git checkout master
git merge topic
```
