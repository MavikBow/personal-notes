# My personal notes
## What is this?

I have decided to dedicate a repository to create my own set of notes in a card file format.  
Here I will write down useful ideas, short notes, Q&A and other things as I consume knowledge from different sources.  
Things that I can refer to later if needed.   

I do not know if I will abandon this project after a week, a month or a year after beginning, but I need to start somewhere.  
I make this repository public.  
As much as I am shy to do this, maybe someone will also find use in the knowledge I put here. 

This repository will have more than just English.  
These will be my personal notes, so I'll be putting things in the way I find best for myself.  
(Incidentally, as of typing this, I only know how to touch type in English :shrug:)  

I got inspired to do this by the youtuber ExtremeCode with his video [Методика обучения технических специалистов](https://youtu.be/jSnw9A0VnWA?si=uPpzL_GKB1xJblme).
I will not necessarily be following his example, but the booklet attached in this directory is a great read indeed.
